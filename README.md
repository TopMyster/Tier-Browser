Isle Browser Nova is the non vibe coded version of the browser. It is better designed and more well maintained. Please do not shame or mock my creation in the issues bar. The bar is only to be used for an issue with the software. Isle browser Nova is created by me alone and I would prefer if people won't mock it. I only vibe coded the original isle browser as an experimental browser to see hiw efficient and well ai could code. Isle browser Nova is a work in progress. ENJOY!üòÅ
