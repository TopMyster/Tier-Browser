Isle Browser prioritizes the websites you visit over controls and tab viewing, while still keeping those features accessible. Keep in mind, Isle Browser Nova is still a work in progress and is nearly twice as fast as the original Isle Browser. ENJOY!üòÅ

Isle Browser Nova is the non vibe coded version of the browser. It is better designed and more well maintained. Please do not shame or mock my creation in the issues bar. The bar is only to be used for an issue with the software. Isle browser Nova is created by me alone and I would prefer if people won't mock it. I only vibe coded the original isle browser as an experimental browser to see how efficient and well ai could code.
